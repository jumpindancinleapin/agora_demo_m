    Columbia Law School is my dream. By the numbers, my potential is below that of the average CLS matriculant. 
    My drive speaks louder. This app exists to showcase my commitment to empowering others, and my ability 
    to innovate and solve problems. 
    
    Not only am I trained in AI from a business perspective, **I am a practioner**. 
    From writing perceptrons to implementing chatbots, I have done it. This app 
    is my take on aligning AI with a law student's responsibilities. I will
    continue to iterate upon it as I learn more about Columbia's values.

    **I have nothing to lose**, and will gladly accept defeat once I have given it my all. 
    Until then, I proceed. This way, upon acceptance, I am deserving of 
    the opportunity that so many qualified candidates do not receive. 


    All the best,

    ***Jake Lindsay***
